Contains the source Semgrep schemas from
https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-interfaces.

I have only added comments to the files as I have gone through them. The actual
content is intact and unmodified.

Note that these JSON schemas are automatically generated by [ahrefs/atdgen][atd]
from the [Adjustable Type Definition (ATD)][atd-docs] files. According to the
Semgrep team, the schemas are not used to generate the Python and TypeScript
classes. They are generated directly from the ATD files.

So far they have been pretty accurate, though.
